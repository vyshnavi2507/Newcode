Yuh, yuh
Yuh, yuh
Your Honour please
Gotta believe what I say
What I will tell
Happened just the other day
I must confess
'Cause I've had about enough
I need your help
Gotta make this here thing stop
Baby I swear I'll tell the truth
About all the things you used to do (c'mon)
And if you thought you had me fooled
I'm telling you now, objection overruled, oh baby
One for the money and the free rides
It's two for the lie that you denied
All rise, all rise (c'mon)
Three for the calls you've been making
It's four all the times you've been faking
All rise, I'm gonna tell it to your face
All rise, I rest my case
You're on the stand
With your back against the wall
Nowhere to run
And nobody you can call, oh no
I just can't wait
Now the case is open wide
You'll try to pray
But the jury will decide
Baby I swear I'll tell the truth (uh-huh)
About all the things you used to do
And if you thought you had me fooled (c'mon)
I'm telling you objection overruled, oh baby
One for the money and the free rides
It's two for the lie that you denied
All rise, all rise (oh, all rise)
Three for the calls you've been making
It's four all the times you've been faking (oh)
All rise, I'm gonna tell it to your face
All rise, I rest my case (uh-huh)
So step back 'cause you don't know this cat
I know deep down that you don't want me to react
I'll lay low, leavin' all my options open
The decision of the jury has not been spoken
Step in my house, you find that your stuff is gone
But in reality, to whom does the stuff belong?
I bring you into court to preach my order
And you know that you overstepped the border, uh-huh
One for the money and the free rides
It's two for the lie that you denied
All rise, all rise (c'mon)
Three for the calls you've been making
It's four all the times you've been faking
All rise, all rise (uh-huh)
